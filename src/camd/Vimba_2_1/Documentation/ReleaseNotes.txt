---------------------
Hardware Requirements
---------------------
PC or laptop with 1 GHz 32-bit or 64-bit x86 processor or better.

When using Allied Vision GigE cameras, a built-in Gigabit Ethernet network interface
or Gigabit Ethernet network card (one or more) is required.

  Note for IP configuration:
  By default, IP Configuration Mode is set to DHCP. 
  You can also select LLA (link-local address) if you connect just one camera. 
  If multiple cameras are connected at the same time, we recommend using 
  DHCP or Persistent IP Address to enable discovery of all cameras.


Furthermore, when using Allied Vision USB cameras, a built-in USB 3.0
controller for PCI Express bus is required.


------------------------
Tested Operating Systems
------------------------
Allied Vision Vimba has been tested with the following operating systems:

  Ubuntu version 14.04 LTS "Trusty Tahr" (32-bit)
  Ubuntu version 16.04 LTS "Xenial Xerus" (32-bit and 64-bit)
  Debian version 7 "Wheezy" (64-bit)
  Fedora version 23 (64-bit)

In most cases, Vimba is also compatible to higher versions or other distributions. 
Updates on tested operating systems are published on the Vimba webpage: 
https://www.alliedvision.com/en/products/software.html

Please note that IEEE 1394 and CL support is not available for Linux.


------------
Installation
------------
Allied Vision Vimba comes as a tarball. In order to set up Vimba, follow these steps:

  - Uncompress the archive with the command tar -xf ./Vimba.tgz to a
    directory you have writing privileges for like /opt. Under this directory
    Vimba will be installed in its own folder. In the following, we will refer
    to this path as [InstallDir].
  - Go to [InstallDir]/VimbaGigETL and/or [InstallDir]/VimbaUSBTL and execute the shell
    script Install.sh with super user privileges (e.g., sudo ./Install.sh). This
    registers the GENICAM_GENTL32_PATH and/or the GENICAM_GENTL64_PATH environment
    variable through a startup script in /etc/profile.d so that every GenICam GenTL
    consumer (such as the examples that ship with Allied Vision Vimba) can access the
    Allied Vision Gigabit Ethernet and USB Transport Layers. Please note that this is a
    per-user setting.
  - Reboot computer

Now you are ready to run the Vimba Viewer. It can be found in, for example,
[InstallDir]/Tools/Viewer/Bin/x86_64bit/.
This program allows you to configure your Allied Vision cameras and capture images.

In order to change the IP configuration of a camera in a foreign subnet,
VimbaViewer must be run with super user privileges
(e.g., sudo -E ./VimbaViewer).
Note that running it as root user instead of using sudo -E requires the
GENICAM_GENTL32_PATH and / or GENICAM_GENTL64_PATH being set for the
root user as well.

Vimba includes many precompiled examples that can be found in
Vimba/VimbaC/Examples/Bin and Vimba/VimbaCPP/Examples/Bin.
If you want to compile these examples yourself, please refer to the Vimba Manual
for instructions and required packages.

For uninstalling Vimba, remove the startup scripts by running the shell scripts
Uninstall.sh as super user. This prevents any GenTL consumer from loading the
Allied Vision Gigabit Ethernet and USB Transport Layers. Then remove the
installation directory.


------------
Known Issues
------------
  - When experiencing trouble with image acquisition, try to increase the priority
    of your application with "sudo -E nice -n -20 <command>".

GigE Transport Layer:
  - A change of the available camera access modes cannot be reported for cameras
    in different subnets or with malconfigured IP addresses. These cameras can
    be accessed in configuration mode from different hosts simultaneously.

Camera detection:
  - If multiple IP addresses are configured on one physical ethernet adapter, 
    then Vimba sends GVCP discovery requests only to the last added IP address.
    Therefore, the camera is detected only if its IP address was added last.

Vimba Viewer:
  - If a GigE camera was opened and then closed with Vimba Viewer, 
    it is displayed as locked and Vimba Viewer does not open it again.
    Workaround: Close and open Vimba Viewer.
  - When multiple opened GigE cameras are disconnected at the same time
    while no other camera stays connected to the very same NIC,
    the Vimba Viewer's camera windows stay open.
